<span class="markdown">
VoCaLS Provenance module focuses on tracking the provenance of stream processing
services, i.e., tracing the consequences of operations performed over the
streams. To this extent, the module defines four classes: (i) vprov:R2ROperator
refers to operators that produce RDF mappings (relations) from other RDF
mappings [2], e.g., sum and count. (ii) vprov:R2SOperator represents operators
that produce a stream from a relation [2], for instance replaying a static
dataset as a stream. (iii) vprov:S2ROperator refers to operators that produces
relations from streams, e.g., windowing. Finally, (iv) vprov:S2SOperator allows
describing operators that produce a stream from another stream. To represent
the most common operators VoCaLS Provenance already contains several subclasses
of the four generic ones presented above, e.g., vprov:WidowOperator,
vprov:SetOperator and vprov:FilterOperator.
