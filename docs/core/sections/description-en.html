<span class="markdown">
The core module introduces the basic abstractions to represent
streams. A (i) vocals:Stream represents a Web stream, i.e. an unbounded
sequence of time-varying data elements, that might be findable and accessible
on the Web, and which can be consumed via a (ii) vocals:StreamEndpoint.
A (iii) vocals:StreamDescriptor is a document accessible via HTTP that
holds metadata about the stream and its contents. Last but not least, a (iv) vocals:FiniteStreamPartition
is a portion of the stream that available for
regular Linked Data services to access and process its content.
