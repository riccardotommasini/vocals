VoCaLS-SD introduces several classes and properties to represent services that deal with streams.

The vsd:StreamingService is an abstraction to represent a service that
deals data streams of any type. Continuous query engines, stream reasoners,
and RDF stream publishers are valid examples.

Three classes of RDF streaming services were identified,
although others could be added if needed: (i) vsd:CatalogService, a
service that may provide metadata about streams, their content, query endpoints
and more. (ii) vsd:PublishingService, which represents a service that
publishes RDF streams (e.g. TripleWave), possibly following a Linked Data compliant
scheme, and (iii) vsd:ProcessingService, which models an RDF stream
processing service that performs any kind of transformation on streaming data,
e.g. querying, reasoning, filtering
